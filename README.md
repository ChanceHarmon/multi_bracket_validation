# multi_bracket_validation
# Challenge Summary
check that brackets of any type are closed properly

## Challenge Description
Using a input of a string, check that all brackets are are properly closed, no matter type or quanity.

## Approach & Efficiency
By the time I finished my interview I was to the point of using counters, and trying to figure out how to compare the counts without writing multiple if statements. I knew It wasn't correct, but I could probably get it there. I believe the idea was to use a stack, but I never got that far last night. Will continue working on it.
